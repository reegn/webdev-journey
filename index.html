This is my web development journey! This website should (hopefully) evolve as I learn more. It should mainly consist of and showcase things that I have learned.

<h1>The Heading Element</h1>
    <h2>This is the heading element. It is made with an opening tag and a closing tag.</h2>
        <h3>Opening Tag:</h3>
            <h4>
                Opening tag is made with angle brackets "<" and ">" and denote the start of an
                html element. The tag name goes inside.
            </h4>
        <h3>Closing Tag:</h3>
            <h4>Closing tag is similar to opening tag, and denotes the end of
                an html element. The tag name consists of a forward slash / followed by the tag name.
            </h4>
        <h3>Content:</h3>
            <h4>
                Content goes in between the opening and closing tags. They are what is shown on
                the website itself.
            </h4>
        <h3>Element:</h3>
            <h4>
                The html element is the entirety of the opening and closing tags in addition
                to the content inside.
            </h4>
        <h3>The Heading Element:</h3>
            <h4>The heading element is usually used for section headers like a table of
                contents. The heading element can only go up to h6, starting from h1.
            </h4>
        <h3>Acceptable heading implementation:</h3>
            <h4>There should usually only be one h1 header element, and no skipped heading levels.</h4>
